# HydroSENS

HydroSENS is an algorithm for the automatic hydrological characterization of natural and urban landscapes.

## Prerequisites

You will need to download the GDAL package natively on your machine to run the project.

For MacOS:

```bash
brew install gdal
```

For Ubuntu / Debian:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gdal-bin libgdal-dev
```

More info: https://gdal.org/en/stable/download.html

## Data

The required inputs include:

-   Shapefile of the intended study area in a projected coordinate system
-   Soil Texture Classes (USDA System) dataset by Hengl (2018). The dataset is available online at: https://zenodo.org/records/2525817.
-   Spectral library file (Data sourced from USGS)
-   Curve Number lookup table

The algorithm is currently designed to extract optical imagery and digital elevation models (DEMs) from Google Earth Engine (GEE)
